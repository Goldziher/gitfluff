    description: Rust-based CLI tool for enforcing Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification with automatic message cleanup and multi-platform distribution. Features built-in presets for removing AI signatures, configurable linting rules via .gitfluff.toml, and seamless Git hook integration (pre-commit, Husky, Lefthook). Distributed as prebuilt binaries through Homebrew, Cargo, npm/npx, and PyPI/uvx with cross-platform support for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
    name: gitfluff
    version: 1.0.0
presets:
    - claude
rules:
    - content: 'All commits must follow Conventional Commits 1.0.0 spec. Use allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore. Include scope when applicable. Mark breaking changes with ''!'' or ''BREAKING CHANGE:'' footer. Test with `gitfluff lint` before committing.'
      name: Conventional Commits Compliance
      priority: critical
    - content: Use anyhow::Result for CLI operations and anyhow::Context for error chain building. Provide actionable error messages that guide users. In src/lint.rs and src/hooks.rs, always add context to IO errors (e.g., '.context("Failed to read commit message file")?').
      name: Error Handling with anyhow
      priority: high
    - content: All linting rules must be configurable via .gitfluff.toml and overridable by CLI flags. Use serde for serialization. Keep src/config.rs as single source of truth. Document all config options in README with examples.
      name: Configuration Management
      priority: high
    - content: Maintain wrapper packages (npm-package/, pip-package/) that download correct prebuilt binary for platform. Update version strings in sync across Cargo.toml, package.json, and pyproject.toml. Test install scripts on macOS, Linux, and Windows before release.
      name: Cross-Platform Binary Distribution
      priority: high
    - content: Write integration tests in tests/cli.rs using assert_cmd and predicates crates. Test all CLI subcommands (lint, hook install) with real commit message files. Verify --write flag modifies files correctly and is idempotent.
      name: Integration Testing
      priority: medium
    - content: In src/hooks.rs, always backup existing hooks before overwriting. Verify Git repository exists before installing hooks. Use atomic file operations. Support both traditional .git/hooks and pre-commit framework workflows.
      name: Hook Installation Safety
      priority: medium
    - content: Keep regex patterns in src/presets.rs focused on reversible cleanups (AI signatures, trailers). Document regex patterns with examples. Test patterns don't accidentally strip legitimate commit content. Update AI signature patterns as new tools emerge.

        ## Development Setup

        ### Prerequisites
        - Rust 1.70+ (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
        - Cargo (included with Rust)

        ### Building from Source

        ```bash
        # Clone the repository
        git clone https://github.com/Goldziher/gitfluff.git
        cd gitfluff

        # Build debug version
        cargo build

        # Build optimized release
        cargo build --release

        # Run locally
        cargo run -- lint --help
        ```

        ### Running Tests

        ```bash
        # Run all tests
        cargo test

        # Run with output
        cargo test -- --nocapture

        # Run specific test file
        cargo test --test cli
        ```

        ### Code Quality

        ```bash
        # Run clippy linter
        cargo clippy -- -D warnings

        # Format code
        cargo fmt

        # Check formatting without modifying
        cargo fmt -- --check
        ```

        ## Project Architecture

        ### Core Rust Application (`src/`)

        - **`main.rs`** - Entry point, CLI argument parsing
        - **`cli.rs`** - Command definitions and handlers (lint, hook commands)
        - **`config.rs`** - Configuration file parsing (`.gitfluff.toml`/`.fluff.toml`)
        - **`lint.rs`** - Core linting logic and Conventional Commits validation
        - **`presets.rs`** - Built-in presets (`conventional`, `conventional-body`, `simple`)
        - **`hooks.rs`** - Git hook installation and management

        ### Distribution Packages

        The project provides multiple distribution channels, each wrapping the core Rust binary:

        **npm (`npm-package/`)**
        - `install.js` - Downloads platform-specific binary on install
        - `bin/gitfluff.js` - Wrapper script that executes the binary
        - Published as `gitfluff` on npm

        **PyPI (`pip-package/`)**
        - `downloader.py` - Fetches binary for the current platform
        - `cli.py` / `__main__.py` - Python wrapper for binary execution
        - Published as `gitfluff` on PyPI

        **Homebrew (`homebrew-tap/Formula/`)**
        - `gitfluff.rb` - Formula for installation via `brew tap goldziher/tap`
        - Auto-updated via `.github/workflows/release-homebrew.yml`

        ### CI/CD (`.github/workflows/`)

        - **`ci.yml`** - Runs tests and clippy on every push
        - **`release.yml`** - Builds cross-platform binaries on tag
        - **`publish.yaml`** - Publishes to crates.io, npm, PyPI
        - **`release-homebrew.yml`** - Updates Homebrew formula

        ## Adding Custom Presets

        Presets are defined in `src/presets.rs` and provide reusable configuration profiles.

        ### Creating a New Preset

        1. **Define preset in `src/presets.rs`:**

        ```rust
        const MY_PRESET: &str = r#"
        preset = "my-preset"

        [rules]
        message_pattern = "^(feat|fix|docs): .+"
        message_description = "Must start with feat, fix, or docs"
        require_body = true

        [[rules.cleanup]]
        find = "(?i)wip"
        replace = "WIP"
        description = "Normalize WIP markers"
        "#;
        ```

        2. **Register in `get_preset()` function:**

        ```rust
        pub fn get_preset(name: &str) -> Option<&'static str> {
            match name {
                "conventional" => Some(CONVENTIONAL),
                "conventional-body" => Some(CONVENTIONAL_BODY),
                "simple" => Some(SIMPLE),
                "my-preset" => Some(MY_PRESET), // Add here
                _ => None,
            }
        }
        ```

        3. **Test the preset:**

        ```bash
        cargo build
        ./target/debug/gitfluff lint --preset my-preset --stdin <<< "feat: test message"
        ```

        ### Built-in Presets

        - **`conventional`** (default) - Full Conventional Commits spec, allows single-line commits
        - **`conventional-body`** - Requires body section for all commits
        - **`simple`** - Single-line commits only, no body/footer parsing
